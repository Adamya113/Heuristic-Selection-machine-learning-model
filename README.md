# Heuristic-Selection-machine-learning-model
## ML modelling for first order theorem prover

#### For proving a first order theorem, certain set of heuristics are required to prove the theorem easily. Selecting the right set of heuristics is a delicate task. 
#### The aim was to identify the most suitable heuristic for a given problem from a set of 5 heuristics. 
The system also has the capability to decline to prove the theorem. A model was trained based on 13 static and 38 dynamic features of the given dataset. 
The accuracy received at end of the training was quite up to the mark, as selecting the right heuristic is not easy even for experienced people.
